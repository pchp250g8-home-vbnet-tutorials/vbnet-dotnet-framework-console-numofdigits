A console application project written in the Visual Basic .Net programming language and implemented in the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated environment. The .Net FrameWork platform provides simple input/output. Determining the number of digits in a number entered from the keyboard.

The program does the following:
1. Prompts the user for an integer.
2. Sets the digit counter variable to zero.
3. Creates a temporary variable with an initial
a positive value equal in magnitude to the number entered from the keyboard.
4. The loop with precondition is executed:
  a) The value of the temporary variable is compared to zero. If its value is greater than zero, the loop continues executing; otherwise, it terminates. (Go to step 5)
  b) The temporary variable is divisible by 10.
  c) The digit counter variable is incremented by one.
5. The entered number and the number of its digits are displayed on the screen.
